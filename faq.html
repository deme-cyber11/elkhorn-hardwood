                        <p>Absolutely. Colorado Springs sits at <strong>6,035 feet</strong> with average humidity around 30–40%. This dry air causes hardwood to contract in winter, creating gaps between boards — that's normal seasonal movement, not a defect. The intense UV at altitude also fades unfinished or poorly finished wood 30% faster than coastal cities. We use UV-resistant finishes and recommend running a humidifier to keep indoor humidity at 35–45% year-round. These Colorado-specific considerations are built into every project we plan.</p>

                        <p>Every refinishing project includes our <strong>3-year finish warranty</strong> covering adhesion failure, peeling, bubbling, and premature wear under normal use. We use Bona Mega ONE commercial-grade finish and NWFA-certified application techniques, so warranty claims are extremely rare. The warranty doesn't cover damage from pet accidents, dragged furniture without felt pads, or standing water — but those are preventable with the basic care guide we provide after every job.</p>

                        <p>Yes — custom stain matching is one of our specialties. We carry <strong>40+ stain samples</strong> and can blend custom colors on-site to match existing trim, stairs, or adjacent rooms. For additions or repairs where you need a seamless blend, we apply test patches directly on your floor so you can approve the color in your home's lighting before we commit to the full area. <a href="services.html#stain">Learn more about our stain color options</a>.</p>

                        <p>Move all furniture off the hardwood areas before our crew arrives — we can recommend local Colorado Springs movers if you need help. Remove wall hangings and curtains near floor level to prevent dust settling on them. Clear closet floors if those are being refinished too. We handle all baseboards, transitions, and floor vents as part of our standard process. Plan for 3–5 days where you'll need to avoid the work areas. <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> for a detailed preparation checklist.</p>

                        <p>With our dustless sanding system, <strong>most families stay in their homes</strong> during the project. You'll need to avoid the active work areas, but you can use other rooms normally. We use low-VOC Bona waterborne finishes that produce minimal odor — far less than traditional oil-based polyurethane. If you have severe chemical sensitivities, we recommend staying elsewhere during finish application days (typically 1–2 days). Many Colorado Springs homeowners with kids and pets stay home throughout the entire process.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>It depends on the wear layer thickness. Engineered hardwood with a <strong>wear layer of 2mm or more</strong> can typically be sanded and refinished once. Floors with thicker 4mm+ wear layers can be refinished multiple times — similar to solid hardwood. We measure the wear layer during our free estimate to determine if your engineered floor is a candidate for refinishing. Many Colorado Springs homes built in the 2000s–2010s have engineered hardwood that's ready for its first refinish.</p>

For high-traffic areas like hallways, kitchens, and commercial spaces, we offer Bona Traffic HD, a two-component finish with even greater durability and scratch resistance. Both are low-VOC, low-odor, and non-yellowing — they won't turn amber over time like old oil-based finishes.</p>

                        <p>Most hardwood floors in Colorado Springs need refinishing every <strong>7–10 years</strong> with normal residential use. High-traffic areas like hallways and kitchens may need attention sooner — every 5–7 years. Homes with dogs typically need refinishing on the shorter end due to claw scratches. Proper maintenance extends the life of your finish: use felt pads on all furniture legs, place area rugs in high-traffic zones, keep indoor humidity at 35–45%, and clean with Bona-approved hardwood floor cleaner (no vinegar or Swiffer WetJet).</p>
