                <h2>Whole-House Sand &amp; Refinish</h2>
                <p>Our most requested service transforms tired, scratched, and faded hardwood floors back to their original beauty — or better. Whether you own a 1960s ranch in Rockrimmon with original red oak or a 2010s Briargate home with builder-grade flooring that's seen better days, whole-house refinishing is the most cost-effective way to dramatically improve your home's look and value.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>Our Refinishing Process</h3>
                <p>Every project begins with a thorough floor assessment. We check board thickness with a moisture meter and gauge, identify problem areas like water damage or loose boards, and evaluate the existing finish. This ensures we choose the right sanding sequence and finish system for your specific floor.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> We mask all baseboards, vents, and transitions. Doors are removed if needed. Nails are set below the surface to prevent sanding damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coarse Sanding:</strong> We start with 36-grit to remove the old finish and level the floor. This is where decades of wear, scratches, and stains disappear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium &amp; Fine Sanding:</strong> Progressive passes with 60-grit and 100-grit create a smooth, uniform surface ready for stain or finish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Staining (Optional):</strong> If you're changing colors, we apply your chosen stain from our library of 40+ options. Test patches are always done first so you can approve the color in your home's lighting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Finish Application:</strong> Two to three coats of Bona Mega ONE waterborne polyurethane, with light buffing between coats. This commercial-grade finish is specifically rated for Colorado's UV intensity and low humidity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Final Inspection:</strong> Walk-through with you to ensure every square foot meets our standard. We provide a written care guide and schedule a 30-day follow-up check.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>What It Costs</h3>
                <p>Whole-house refinishing in Colorado Springs typically runs <strong>$3–$8 per square foot</strong>, depending on floor condition and finish choice. A 1,200 sq ft home averages $3,600–$6,000. See our <a href="cost-guide.html">complete pricing guide</a> for detailed breakdowns by project size and finish type.</p>

                <h3>Timeline</h3>
                <p>Most homes take 3–5 days from start to furniture move-back. Colorado Springs' dry climate at 6,035 feet actually accelerates finish curing — you'll typically walk on your floors 24 hours sooner than homeowners in humid coastal cities.</p>

                <h2>Dustless Hardwood Floor Sanding</h2>
                <p>Traditional floor sanding generates massive amounts of fine wood dust that infiltrates every surface in your home — cabinets, closets, HVAC ducts, electronics. At Colorado Springs' elevation of 6,035 feet, lower air density means fine particles stay airborne 40% longer than at sea level. For families with allergies, asthma, or simply anyone who doesn't want a week-long cleanup, dustless sanding is the clear choice.</p>

                <div class="service-detail-img">
                    <img src="images/services/dustless-sanding.webp" alt="Dustless hardwood floor sanding equipment in use at a Colorado Springs home" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy">
                </div>

                <h3>How Our Dustless System Works</h3>
                <p>We use commercial-grade HEPA-filtered vacuum systems connected directly to every sanding tool via 4-inch hoses. The vacuums generate continuous negative pressure at the sanding point, capturing 99% of dust before it ever becomes airborne. The remaining 1%? Our HEPA air scrubbers handle that — running continuously throughout the project to filter ambient air down to 0.3-micron particles.</p>

                <h3>Benefits for Colorado Springs Homes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No plastic sheeting needed</strong> — save time and avoid the suffocating sealed-room approach</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay in your home</strong> — many families remain in the house during dustless projects, just avoiding the work area</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect your HVAC</strong> — at our altitude, furnaces run hard in winter; dust in your ducts means it recirculates for months</li>
                    <li><strong>Better finish adhesion</strong> — less ambient dust means fewer particles settling into wet finish coats, resulting in a smoother final surface</li>
                    <li><strong>Pet and allergy safe</strong> — critical for the many Colorado Springs households with pets and altitude-sensitive respiratory systems</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Dustless Sanding Pricing</h3>
                <p>Dustless sanding adds <strong>$0.50–$1.00 per square foot</strong> over traditional sanding, bringing the total to approximately <strong>$3.50–$5.00 per square foot</strong> for a complete sand-and-refinish. For a 1,000 sq ft project, that's $500–$1,000 more — a modest investment that eliminates the dust nightmare entirely. Most Colorado Springs homeowners who've experienced both methods say they'd never go back to traditional sanding.</p>

                <h2>Custom Stain &amp; Color Change</h2>
                <p>Nothing transforms a home faster than changing the color of your hardwood floors. That orangey 1990s golden oak? We can take it to a rich espresso, a modern cool gray, a classic natural, or any of 40+ colors in between. Colorado Springs homeowners are increasingly choosing darker tones and weathered grays that complement our mountain-modern architectural style and the natural Pikes Peak landscape visible through their windows.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>Our Color Consultation Process</h3>
                <p>We don't show you swatches on a card and ask you to imagine. We bring our full stain library to your home and apply 3–5 test patches directly on your actual floor, in your lighting, in the room where it matters. Stain looks completely different on red oak versus white oak versus maple — and it looks different under your south-facing windows than under overhead LEDs. You approve the exact color on your floor before we commit to the full project.</p>

                <h3>Popular Colors in Colorado Springs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Warm Walnut:</strong> The most requested color in Broadmoor and Briargate — rich, warm brown that hides wear and complements both traditional and transitional decor</li>
                    <li><strong>Weathered Gray:</strong> Trending in modern farmhouse and mountain-contemporary homes throughout the Pikes Peak region</li>
                    <li><strong>Classic Natural:</strong> Letting the wood's natural grain shine with a clear finish — popular in historic Old Colorado City homes with original hardwood</li>
                    <li><strong>Espresso/Dark Brown:</strong> Bold, dramatic, and stunning in open-concept layouts with lighter walls and cabinetry</li>
                    <li><strong>Whitewashed Oak:</strong> Light, airy, Scandinavian-inspired — growing in popularity in newer Falcon and Monument homes</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>UV Considerations at Altitude</h3>
                <p>Colorado Springs receives 30% more UV radiation than coastal cities. Unstained or lightly stained floors will shift color noticeably faster here. We use UV-inhibiting sealers and finishes to slow the process, and we advise customers on window treatments and area rug placement to prevent uneven fading, especially in south- and west-facing rooms with Pikes Peak views.</p>

                <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Custom stain and color change runs <strong>$4–$9 per square foot</strong> including sanding, staining, and multi-coat finish. <a href="contact.html">Request a free estimate</a> for your project.</p>

                <h2>Whole-House &amp; Commercial Refinishing</h2>
                <p>Large-scale refinishing requires different logistics than a single-room project. Whether you're refinishing 3,000 square feet in a Broadmoor estate or restoring the hardwood in a downtown Colorado Springs restaurant, we coordinate room-by-room scheduling, after-hours work windows, and phased completion plans that keep disruption minimal.</p>

                <h3>Residential Whole-House Projects</h3>
                <p>For homes over 1,500 square feet, we typically work in phases — living areas first, then bedrooms, then hallways and closets. This lets you continue living in the home during the project by rotating through rooms. We move your furniture for you on project day and return it as each section cures.</p>

                <h3>Commercial Floor Refinishing</h3>
                <p>We refinish hardwood floors in restaurants, dance studios, yoga studios, retail spaces, offices, and gym facilities throughout El Paso County. Our commercial clients include spaces along Tejon Street in downtown Colorado Springs, studios in Manitou Springs, and athletic facilities near the Olympic Training Center.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After-hours and weekend scheduling to avoid business interruption</li>
                    <li>Fast-cure commercial finishes for 24-hour turnaround when needed</li>
                    <li>Gym floor refinishing with proper sport-line painting and polyurethane topcoats</li>
                    <li>Restaurant-grade finishes rated for heavy foot traffic and spill resistance</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Commercial pricing</strong> starts at <strong>$2.50–$6 per square foot</strong> depending on scope, schedule, and finish requirements. <a href="contact.html">Contact us for a commercial quote</a>.</p>

                <h2>Hardwood Floor Repair &amp; Board Replacement</h2>
                <p>Not every hardwood floor needs a full refinish. Sometimes the issue is localized — water damage from a leaking dishwasher in your Briargate kitchen, pet stains that penetrated through the finish in a Rockrimmon living room, or a handful of cracked boards near the entry of your Old Colorado City bungalow. We handle targeted repairs that restore your floor without the cost and disruption of a whole-house project.</p>

                <div class="service-detail-img">
                    <img src="images/services/board-replacement.webp" alt="Hardwood floor board replacement and repair in progress in Colorado Springs" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy">
                </div>

                <h3>Common Repairs We Handle</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Water damage restoration:</strong> Warped, cupped, or buckled boards from plumbing leaks, appliance failures, or flooding. We assess the subfloor, replace damaged boards, and refinish to blend seamlessly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Board replacement:</strong> Individual boards that are cracked, split, or gouged beyond what sanding can fix. We carry a salvage inventory of reclaimed hardwood — oak, maple, hickory, and walnut — to match vintage floors in older Colorado Springs neighborhoods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gap filling:</strong> Colorado's dry winters cause hardwood to contract, leaving gaps between boards. We fill gaps with flexible wood filler that moves with seasonal expansion and contraction at our 30–40% humidity levels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pet damage repair:</strong> Deep scratches, urine stains that have penetrated the wood — we sand to bare wood, treat with oxalic acid to bleach stains, and refinish to a uniform color.</li>
                    <li><strong>Squeaky floor repair:</strong> Subfloor separation causing squeaks underfoot — we refasten boards to joists and shim where needed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Repair pricing</strong> ranges from <strong>$500–$2,000 per project</strong> depending on scope. Small repairs (under 20 sq ft) can often be completed in a single day. <a href="contact.html">Send us photos of the damage</a> for a quick estimate.</p>

                <h2>Hardwood Floor Installation</h2>
                <p>Building a new home in Falcon or Monument? Replacing carpet with hardwood in your Security-Widefield ranch? We install solid and engineered hardwood flooring with the same precision and care we bring to refinishing. Proper installation starts with the subfloor — and at Colorado Springs' altitude, acclimation and moisture management are absolutely critical.</p>

                <h3>Installation Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nail-down installation:</strong> The traditional method for solid hardwood over wood subfloors. We use pneumatic nailers with the correct angle and spacing for each species. Best for 3/4-inch solid hardwood in homes with plywood or OSB subfloors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glue-down installation:</strong> Required for engineered hardwood over concrete — common in Colorado Springs basements and slab-on-grade homes. We use moisture-barrier adhesives that prevent vapor transmission from concrete.</li>
                    <li><strong>Floating installation:</strong> Engineered planks with click-lock profiles that float over an underlayment. Fastest method, ideal for budget-conscious projects or areas where subfloor conditions vary.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Acclimation Matters at 6,035 Feet</h3>
                <p>Wood shipped from mills at lower elevations arrives with higher moisture content than Colorado Springs' ambient conditions. If installed too soon, boards will shrink as they equilibrate to our 30–40% humidity, creating gaps and potential cupping. We require a minimum 7–10 day acclimation period with the wood stored in your home at normal living conditions. We verify moisture content with a pin meter before installation day — your floor should read within 2% of the subfloor.</p>

                <h3>Species We Install</h3>
                <p>Red oak, white oak, hickory, maple, walnut, Brazilian cherry, and engineered options from Bona, Shaw, and Mohawk. We help you choose based on your lifestyle (kids? dogs?), traffic patterns, and aesthetic preferences. Hickory is increasingly popular in Colorado Springs for its hardness and rustic grain pattern that complements mountain-style homes.</p>

                <p><strong>Installation pricing:</strong> <strong>$6–$15 per square foot</strong> installed, including subfloor prep and transitions. Species, method, and layout complexity affect final pricing. <a href="contact.html">Request a free installation estimate</a>.</p>
